How to Use
1. Build Your Resume
Start Editing: Begin by clicking on the placeholder text "Your Name" and "Your Professional Title" at the top of the resume preview to add your personal information.

Add Sections: On the left sidebar, you'll find "Available Sections." Click and drag any of these sections (e.g., "Education," "Experience") onto the main resume preview area. The "Drag and drop sections here" hint will disappear once you add your first section.

Customize Content:

Once a section is on the canvas, click on any text within it to directly edit the content.

Delete Entries: Hover over an individual entry within a section. A red - icon will appear at the top right of the entry. Click it to remove that specific entry.

Delete Sections: Hover over an entire section. A red trash can icon will appear at the top right of the section container. Click it to remove the entire section from your resume.

ATS Friendliness Explained
The resume generated by this tool is designed to be highly ATS-friendly due to:

Clean HTML Structure: Uses standard, semantic HTML tags for content organization, making it easy for ATS to parse.

Plain Text Content: Relies on direct text input, avoiding complex graphics or embedded images that can confuse ATS.

Simple Layout: Maintains a clean, linear layout that ATS systems can easily process without misinterpreting sections.

Standard Typography: Uses a common, readable font ("Inter") to ensure consistent rendering across different systems.
